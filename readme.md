## Feedback

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback on any of my material, please contact me through twitter [@vcsjones](https://twitter.com/vcsjones).

I can't guarentee that I will see issues opened or pull requests on this repository.

## Completeness

Not every presentation I've ever given is here. This may either be because the presentation is owned by someone else,
the presentation is old and I haven't taken the time to commit it, or because I forgot. If there is a particular 
presentation that you are interested in and can't find it here, please see the [Feedback](#feedback) section to contact
me and if I can provide the presentation.
